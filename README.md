# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my first full coding website. I'm using this project to implement things I learned with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. As well as keep track of my notes during my bootcamp.

As I continue learning, I would like to update this website and showcase my skills and create cool functionality.
